Excellent! This is a forward-thinking project that tackles a critical problem in the AI space. Here is the name and detailed PRD.

### Project Name: **VeriChain AI**

**Reasoning:** The name combines "Verifiable" and "Chain," directly speaking to the core value proposition: creating a verifiable chain of provenance for AI assets on the blockchain. It's professional, technical, and clearly communicates the purpose to builders and enterprises in the AI space.

### Product Requirements Document (PRD) for VeriChain AI

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Author:** [Your Name/Team Name]
**Status:** Draft

### 1. Overview & Vision

**Vision Statement:** To establish the foundational layer of trust for Artificial Intelligence by leveraging Bitcoin's security to create an immutable, crowdsourced truth for AI data and model provenance.

**Problem Statement:** The AI industry is plagued by a "garbage in, garbage out" problem. The provenance of training data is often opaque, leading to models that hallucinate, perpetuate biases, or are trained on copyrighted material without attribution. There is no scalable, trustless mechanism to verify the quality, lineage, and licensing of AI datasets and models, creating massive risks for developers and enterprises.

**Solution:** VeriChain AI is a decentralized curation marketplace where stakeholders (data scientists, developers, domain experts) can stake value to collectively assess and validate the quality of AI datasets and models. This creates a cryptoeconomic consensus on "good" data, rewards high-quality providers, and creates an immutable, tamper-proof record on the Stacks blockchain and Bitcoin ledger.

### 2. Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goals (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):**

1.  Launch a platform for listing AI datasets (initially focused on image or text datasets).
2.  Implement a staking and voting mechanism where curators stake STX to vote on dataset quality based on clear criteria.
3.  Create a transparent reward distribution system that pays data providers based on positive consensus.
4.  Implement a basic provenance tracker that links a dataset to its final rating and curator votes on the Bitcoin ledger.
5.  Onboard 50 high-quality datasets and 200 active curators.

**Future Goals (Post-MVP):**

1.  Expand to AI model validation and auditing.
2.  Introduce a native governance and reward token (VERI?).
3.  Develop advanced features like "validation challenges" where stakers can dispute a dataset's quality.
4.  Integrate with popular AI platforms (Hugging Face, Kaggle) via APIs.
5.  Create "Model Cards" and "Data Cards" that are permanently anchored to Bitcoin.

### 3. User Stories & Features

**As a Data Provider, I want to:**

- US-1: List my dataset on the marketplace by uploading metadata (description, license, size) and a hash of the dataset (stored on Gaia/IPFS) to the smart contract.
- US-2: Set a bounty pool in STX to incentivize curators to validate my dataset.
- US-3: View all votes and comments from curators on my dataset.
- US-4: Receive rewards from the protocol based on the final consensus score of my dataset.

**As a Curator (Validator), I want to:**

- US-5: Browse datasets awaiting validation, filtered by category and bounty size.
- US-6: Stake STX on a dataset to vote on its quality based on predefined criteria (e.g., `accuracy`, `bias`, `documentation`, `license-clarity`).
- US-7: Provide a written justification for my vote to add context.
- US-8: Earn a share of the bounty and protocol rewards if my vote aligns with the final consensus.
- US-9: See my reputation score increase based on successful validations.

**As a Data Consumer (AI Developer), I want to:**

- US-10: Search for datasets with high veracity scores and see the complete validation history.
- US-11: Trust that the provenance and quality metrics are immutably recorded on Bitcoin.
- US-12: Filter datasets by specific quality attributes (e.g., "show me all text datasets with a 'low-bias' score above 90%").

### 4. Functional Requirements

**1. Dataset Listing:**

- `dataset-registry.clar`
- `list-dataset(dataset-hash {buff 128}, bounty-amount uint, metadata-uri {string-ascii 255})`
- Stores a unique ID, provider address, dataset hash (pin to IPFS via Gaia), and bounty.

**2. Staking & Curation Mechanism:**

- `curation-engine.clar`
- `stake-and-vote(dataset-id uint, vote {quality-score: int, ...})`: Curators stake STX to submit a vote. The stake is locked for the voting period.
- A quadratic voting or weighted average mechanism is used to prevent whale manipulation.
- A voting period is defined (e.g., 14 days).

**3. Consensus & Reward Distribution:**

- `reward-calculator.clar`
- At the end of the voting period, a final score is calculated.
- Curators whose votes are within a certain range of the final consensus get their stake returned plus a proportional share of the dataset's bounty and protocol rewards.
- Curators who are consistently outside the consensus (potential bad actors) lose a portion of their stake (slashing), which is added to the reward pool.

**4. Provenance & Immutable Ledger:**

- The final dataset score, a hash of the top curator comments, and the dataset ID are committed in a single transaction to the Stacks blockchain, which is then anchored to Bitcoin. This creates a permanent, timestamped record.

**5. Reputation System:**

- `reputation-tracker.clar`
- Tracks each curator's address and assigns a reputation score based on their history of consensus-aligned validations. This score can weight future votes.

### 5. Technical Architecture & Core Stack

| Component                      | Technology                        | Description                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Smart Contracts**            | **Clarity**                       | `dataset-registry`, `curation-engine`, `reward-calculator`, `reputation-tracker`.                     |
| **Front-end App**              | **Next.js / React**               | TypeScript-based dApp interface for all user interactions.                                            |
| **Wallet Integration**         | **Hiro Wallet**                   | For authentication, staking, and transactions.                                                        |
| **Decentralized Storage**      | **Gaia / IPFS (via Stacks.js)**   | For storing the actual dataset files and detailed metadata. Only the content hash is stored on-chain. |
| **Data Indexing**              | **Hiro API / Stacks.js**          | To query on-chain data for the marketplace frontend.                                                  |
| **Off-chain Compute (Future)** | **Chainlink Functions / Oracles** | For future integrations, e.g., to run basic checks on datasets or fetch external verification.        |

### 6. Key Metrics for Success (KPIs)

- **Number of High-Quality Datasets Listed** (with a veracity score > 80%).
- **Number of Active Curators.**
- **Total Value Staked (TVS)** in the curation economy.
- **Curator Accuracy Rate** (measure of consensus stability).
- **Dataset Usage Rate** (measured by downloads from returned Gaia/IPFS links).

### 7. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                  | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subjectivity of Quality**           | Quality is defined by clear, community-voted-on criteria. Use weighted scores across multiple dimensions (accuracy, bias, etc.) rather than a single number.                         |
| **Collusion / Sybil Attacks**         | The staking requirement creates economic friction. Quadratic voting reduces the power of large stakers. A reputation system rewards honest actors over time.                         |
| **Data Privacy & Copyright**          | The platform does not store the data on-chain, only hashes and metadata. Providers are responsible for licensing. The system validates the data _as presented_ by the provider.      |
| **Scalability of Large Datasets**     | Only hashes are stored on-chain. The heavy data itself is stored on decentralized storage (Gaia/IPFS), which is designed for this purpose.                                           |
| **Initial Liquidity (Bootstrapping)** | Start with a focus on a niche AI community (e.g., open-source NLP datasets). Use a protocol-owned treasury to fund initial bounties and attract high-quality providers and curators. |
